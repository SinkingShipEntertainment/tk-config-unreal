Configuration for running Shotgun with the Unreal Engine
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Toolkit configuration was forked from tk-config-default2 and updates
from that configuration are regularly merged in.

This configuration extends the tk-config-default2 configuration with an 
Unreal engine as well as several unreal related options in Maya.

For more information how to use the unreal engine, please see the support
documentation:
